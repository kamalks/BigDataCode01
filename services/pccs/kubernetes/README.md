# Deploy BigDL-PCCS on Kubernetes

## Prerequests

- Please make sure you have a workable **Kubernetes cluster/machine**.
- Please make sure you have a usable https proxy.
- Please make sure you have an usable PCCS ApiKey for your platform. The PCCS uses this API key to request collaterals from Intel's Provisioning Certificate Service. User needs to subscribe first to obtain an API key. For how to subscribe to Intel Provisioning Certificate Service and receive an API key, goto https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/provisioning-certification and click on 'Subscribe'.

## 1. Pull/Build the PCCS Image

We encapsulate host PCCS service into a docker image, which enables a user-friendly container-service.

Download image as below:

```bash
docker pull intelanalytics/pccs:0.3.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Or you are allowed to build the image manually:

```bash
cd ../pccs
# configure build parameters in build-docker-image.sh
bash build-docker-image.sh
cd ../kubernetes
```
## 2. Start BigDL-PCCS on Kubernetes 
### 2.1 Determine PCCS IP address
First of all, Please note that an **IP address that unused in your subnetwork** is needed to be used as PCCS IP. \
**Especially,** this IP address chosen for PCCS **SHOULD NOT** be the real machine IP address. \
You could check if the IP address is available like this.

```bash
# assume your IP address is 1.2.3.4, and you want to use 1.2.3.226 as PCCS IP
ping 1.2.3.226

# information below means 1.2.3.226 is expected to be an appropriate IP addess for PCCS. 
# otherwise, you are supposed to test another one.
PING 1.2.3.226 (1.2.3.226) 56(84) bytes of data.
From 1.2.3.4 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
From 1.2.3.4 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable
From 1.2.3.4 icmp_seq=3 Destination Host Unreachable
........
```

### 2.2 Modify the script and deploy BigDL-PCCS
Then, modify parameters in `install-bigdl-pccs.sh` as following, and `pccsIP` should be the IP address you have determined in step 2.1.
```bash
# reset of other parameters in values.yaml is optional, please check according to your environment
pccsIP: your_pccs_ip_to_use_as                    --->   <an_used_ip_address_in_your_subnetwork_to_assign_to_pccs>

# replace the below parameters according to your environment
apiKey: your_intel_pcs_server_subscription_key_obtained_through_web_registeration
countryName: your_country_name
cityName: your_city_name
organizaitonName: your_organizaition_name
commonName: server_fqdn_or_your_name
emailAddress: your_email_address
serverPassword: your_server_password_to_use 
```
Then, deploy BigDL-PCCS on kubernetes:

```bash
bash install-bigdl-pccs.sh
```
Check the service whether it has successfully been running (it may take seconds):

```bash
kubectl get all -n bigdl-pccs

# you will get similar to below
NAME            READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
pod/pccs-0      1/1     Running       0          18s

NAME           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)     AGE
service/pccs   ClusterIP   1.7.4.251   1.2.3.4   18081/TCP   18s

NAME                    READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/pccs   1/1     18s

```

## 3. Check if pccs service is running and available:
Execute command to check if pccs service is available.
```bash
curl -v -k -G "https://<your_pccs_ip>:<your_pccs_port>/sgx/certification/v3/rootcacrl"

# you will get similar to below if success

The service is ready once you receive the root CA.

## 4. Delete BigDL-PCCS from Kuberbets
Run the uninstall script as below
```bash
bash uninstall-bigdl-pccs.sh

# you will get similar to below if success
service "pccs" deleted
statefulset.apps "pccs" deleted
namespace "bigdl-pccs" deleted

```
