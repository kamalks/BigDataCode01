# Deploy BigDL-eHSM-KMS on Kubernetes



![ehsm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108786898/197957072-a1574387-3dbb-4cda-be52-4bb5fcb06d0c.png)


**pccs** provides SGX attestation support service.

**dkeyserver** generates domain keys inside enclave.

**dkeycache** caches keys and thus increases key hit ratio. It communicates with dkeyserver based on pccs.

**couchdb** stores run-time data (like enroll info), the persistent is based on Kubernetes PV and NFS. 

**bigdl-ehsm-kms-deployment** is the direct key service provider.


## Prerequests

- Please make sure you have a workable **Kubernetes cluster/machine**.
- Please make sure you have a usable https proxy.
- Please make sure your **CPU** is able to run PCCS service, which generate and verify quotes.
- Please make sure you have a reachable **NFS**.
- Please make sure you have an usable PCCS ApiKey for your platform. The PCCS uses this API key to request collaterals from Intel's Provisioning Certificate Service. User needs to subscribe first to obtain an API key. For how to subscribe to Intel Provisioning Certificate Service and receive an API key, goto https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/provisioning-certification and click on 'Subscribe'.


## 1. Deploy BigDL-PCCS on Kubernetes
If you already have a BigDL-PCCS service on Kubernetes, please skip this step.

If not, please **[deploy BigDL-PCCS on Kubernetes](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/tree/main/ppml/services/pccs/kubernetes)**.
## 2. Start BigDL-eHSM-KMS on Kubernetes 
### 2.1 Determine IP addresses for dkeyserver and KMS
First of all , **IP address that unused in your subnetwork** is needed as KMS external service IP, and it should be different from PCCS IP that you have set in step 1. \
**Especially,** the IP addresses chosen for dkeyserver and KMS **SHOULD NOT** be real machine IP address. \
You could check if the IP adresses are available for dkeyserver and KMS like this
```bash
# assume your IP address is 1.2.3.4, and you want to use 1.2.3.227 as dkeyserver IP
ping 1.2.3.227

# information below means 1.2.3.227 is expected to be an appropriate IP addess for dkeyserver. 
# otherwise, you are supposed to test another one.
PING 1.2.3.227 (1.2.3.227) 56(84) bytes of data.
From 1.2.3.4 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host **Unreachable**
........

# try another IP address (e.g 1.2.3.228) for KMS with the same approach.
```

### 2.2 Modify the script and deploy BigDL-eHSM-KMS
Please make sure current workdir is `kubernetes`.

Then modify parameters in `install-bigdl-ehsm-kms.sh` as following. \
The `pccsIP` should be the IP address you have used in step 1. The `dkeyserverIP` and `kmsIP` should be the IP addresses you have determined in step 2.1. 
The `dkeyserverNodeName` is the fixed node which you want to assign `dkeyserver` pod to. You can run `kubectl get nodes`, and choose one. Then, run `mkdir -p /var/run/ehsm` on the host of node which you chose, this will create a hostPath volume for `dkeyserver` to store logs persistently.

```shell
# reset of other parameters in values.yaml is optional, please check according to your environment
nfsServerIP: your_nfs_server_ip                   --->   <the_IP_address_of_your_NFS_server>
nfsPath: a_nfs_shared_folder_path_on_the_server   --->   <an_existing_shared_folder_path_on_NFS_server>
......
pccsURL: your_pccs_URL_like_https://xxxx:yyyy     --->   <the_URL_of_PCCS_service_you_have_deployed_in_step1>
kmsIP: your_kms_ip_to_use_as                      --->   <an_unused_ip_address_in_your_subnetwork_to_assign_to_kms>
dkeyserverNodeName: the_fixed_node_you_want_to_assign_dkeyserver_to --->   <a_node_name_in_k8s_cluster_to_run_dkerysever_on>
```

Then, deploy BigDL-eHSM-KMS on kubernetes:

```bash
bash install-bigdl-ehsm-kms.sh
```

Check the service whether it has successfully been running (it may take seconds). \
**Note:** the `EXTERNAL-IP` of `service/bigdl-ehsm-kms-service` is the **KMS IP**. 

```bash
kubectl get all -n bigdl-ehsm-kms

# you will get similar to below
