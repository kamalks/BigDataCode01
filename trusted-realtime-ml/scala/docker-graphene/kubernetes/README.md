## Deploying Trusted Realtime ML for Kubernetes

### Configurables

The file `templates/flink-configuration-configmap.yaml` contains the configurable parameters of the deployments. Most of the parameters have self-explanatory names.
You can configure these at will, but it is adviced to keep `flink.jobmanager.ip` as it is.
It is worth mentioning that you can run the components without using sgx by setting the value of `sgx.mode` to `no_sgx`.

### Secure keys and password

You need to [generate secure keys and password][keysNpassword]. Modify the `OUTPUT` in both `../../../../scripts/generate-keys.sh` and `../../../../scripts/generate-password.sh` to your present working directory, and run both scripts. Then, run

```bash
kubectl apply -f ../../../../scripts/keys/keys.yaml
kubectl apply -f ../../../../scripts/password/password.yaml
```

### Using [Helm][helmsite] to deploy all components

If you have installed Helm, you can use Helm to deploy all the `yaml` files at once. In `values.yaml`, configure the full paths for `start-all-but-flink.sh` and `enclave-key.pem`, as well as the ppml image to be used.

Then, simply run

``` bash
helm install <name> ./
```

where `<name>` is a name you give for this installation.

### Deploying everything by hand

Alternatively, you can also deploy everything one by one. All of the following `yaml` files are in `templates`.

#### Deploy the Flink job manager and task manager

In `jobmanager-session-deployment.yaml` and `taskmanager-session-deployment.yaml`, look for `{{ .Values.enclaveKeysPath }}`, and configure the paths accordingly. Then, run

```bash
# Configuration and service definition
kubectl create -f flink-configuration-configmap.yaml
kubectl create -f jobmanager-service.yaml
# Create the deployments for the cluster
kubectl create -f jobmanager-deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f taskmanager-statefulset.yaml
```

Both the job manager and the task manager will start automatically in SGX on top of Graphene libos when the deployments are created.

#### Deploy cluster serving

In `master-deployment.yaml`, look for `{{ .Values.startAllButFlinkPath }}` and `{{ .Values.enclaveKeysPath }}`, and configure these two paths accordingly.

Finally, run

```bash
kubectl apply -f master-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f redis-service.yaml
```

The components (Redis, http-frontend, and cluster serving) should start on their own, if jobmanager and taskmanager are running.

### Port forwarding

You can set up port forwarding to access the containers' ports on the host.
Taking jobmanager’s web ui port `8081` as an example:

1. Run `kubectl port-forward ${flink-jobmanager-pod} --address 0.0.0.0 8081:8081` to forward your jobmanager’s web ui port to local 8081.
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8081 in your browser.

The same goes for the master deployment's ports 6379, 10020, and 10023. Remember to change the name of the pod to that of the master pod.
